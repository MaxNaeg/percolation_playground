# Percolation

The PDF contains some slides to introduce percolation from scratch and instructions for a challenge to find percolation thresholds either numerically or analytically.

The notebook contains code to numerically approximate the percolation threshold of the square, triangular, and honeycomb lattice for both site and bond percolation. 
The focus of this code is readability and not execution time. The notebook is the solution to the numerical challenge introduced in the slides. 
Consider providing the SquareGraphEdge class to the participants to make the challenge easier.
